# acf-tools / 2012 Child Theme

This repo is the skeleton for using ACF fields for an theme options page and a hero slider page

Many props to Marc Wensauer (https://github.com/daslicht) who helped me understand how jQuery and wp_localize_script work together.

The hero slider page uses the template "slider-page.php". If you'd like to implement it, import the export from ACF in the acf directory.
